                            Introduction</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Parthenius AI Studio's
                            mobile and web applications, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By
                            creating an account or using the Service in any way, you acknowledge that you have read,
                            understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy
                            (incorporated
                            here by reference). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the
                            Service.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Parties:</strong> When we say "Parthenius AI Studio,"
                            "we," "us," or "our," we mean Generative AI Teknoloji Anonim Şirketi, the company providing
                            the Service, and its affiliates, agents, and licensors. "You" or "User" refers to the
                            individual or legal entity accessing the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of
                            an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to
                            these
                            Terms, in which case "you" refers to the organization.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 13 years
                            old
                            (or the minimum legal age in your country to form a binding contract, if higher) to use our
                            Service. If you are between 13 and 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you may
                            use the Service only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be
                            bound by these Terms. The Service is not intended for children under 13. By using the
                            Service,
                            you represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirements, and that all
                            registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You are responsible for
                            maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials and for all activities
                            that
                            occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, you must
                            notify us immediately.</p>

                            Accounts and Registration</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            To access certain features of the Service (such as creating AI-generated videos or saving
                            your
                            projects), you may need to create an account. When you register, you agree to provide true,
                            current, and complete information about yourself as prompted, and to update this information
                            as needed to keep it accurate. You are responsible for safeguarding your account. Keep your
                            password secure and do not share it with anyone. You must not impersonate someone else or
                            create an account for anyone other than yourself (unless you are a parent/guardian creating
                            an account for a minor as allowed). You must not create multiple accounts for disruptive or
                            abusive purposes, or sell/trade accounts.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            You are responsible for all activities conducted through your account, whether or not
                            authorized by you. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of
                            your credentials (but you may be liable to us or others for such unauthorized use). We
                            reserve the right to require you to change your username or deny the use of any username for
                            any reason (for example, if a username is obscene or violates someone's rights).
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We may offer the Service for free and/or through paid subscriptions or purchases. Additional
                            terms (such as subscription durations, renewal, and cancellation policies) will be presented
                            to you when purchasing any paid services, and those terms are hereby incorporated into these
                            Terms. All fees (if any) are stated inclusive of applicable taxes unless specified. By
                            providing payment information, you represent that you are authorized to use the payment
                            method and you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the fees to it.
                            Except as required by law, all payments are non-refundable (unless explicitly stated
                            otherwise for a specific service).
                        </p>

                            style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 400;">
                            Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We strive to maintain a respectful, safe, and lawful environment for all users. By using the
                            Service, you agree NOT to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Illegal or Harmful Conduct:</strong> You will not use
                            the Service for any purpose that is illegal under any applicable law. This includes (but is
                            not limited to) refraining from using the Service to create, upload, transmit, or store any
                            content that: (a) is unlawful, fraudulent, or promotes illegal activities (e.g.,
                            instructions
                            for making weapons, drug trafficking, fraud schemes); (b) is defamatory, libelous, or
                            invasive
                            of another's privacy; (c) is obscene, pornographic, or sexually exploitative (particularly
                            content involving minors, which is strictly forbidden); or (d) incites violence or any form
                            of
                            hate against any group or individual. You also agree not to use the Service to stalk,
                            harass,
                            or harm another person.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Abusive Content and Harassment:</strong> You will not
                            use the Service to generate or disseminate content that is harassing, threatening, or
                            hateful.
                            This includes content that targets someone for abuse on the basis of characteristics such as
                            race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any
                            other characteristic protected by law. The Service's AI tools should not be used to bully,
                            troll, or intimidate anyone. Similarly, you must not engage in personal attacks, doxxing
                            (publishing others' private information), or encouragement of self-harm or suicide.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Intellectual Property Infringement:</strong> You will
                            not
                            upload or input any material to the Service unless you have the rights or permissions needed
                            to do so. This means you must not use the Service to share or generate content that violates
                            copyrights, trademarks, or other proprietary rights of any party. For example, do not upload
                            someone else's images or videos without permission, and do not use the AI to create content
                            that is a counterfeit of a copyrighted work (like generating an image of Mickey Mouse, which
                            could infringe Disney's rights). You are responsible for the content you provide – by
                            providing any input (text, images, etc.), you represent and warrant that you have all
                            necessary
                            rights to that input and that our use of it in providing the Service (and any output
                            generated
                            from it) will not infringe or misappropriate any third-party rights.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Malicious Activities:</strong> You must not use the
                            Service in a way that could harm, disable, overburden, or impair our systems or networks, or
                            interfere with any other party's use of the Service. This includes not attempting to hack or
                            gain unauthorized access to any servers, accounts, or computer systems associated with the
                            Service. You agree not to distribute viruses, worms, or any malicious code through the
                            Service. Also, you may not use the Service to generate phishing content or to facilitate any
                            kind of cyberattack or illegal surveillance.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Circumvention and Misuse:</strong> You must not attempt
                            to bypass any content filtering, security measures, rate limits, or usage restrictions that
                            we
                            have put in place. For instance, you should not try to reverse engineer the Service, or use
                            bots/scrapers to extract data or otherwise exploit the Service in an unintended manner. You
                            agree not to use the Service for the purpose of competing with us or replicating our models
                            (for example, you should not systematically query the AI with the aim of creating your own
                            dataset/model). Additionally, do not use automation or scripts to create accounts or
                            generate content at a volume that a human user could not reasonably produce.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Fraud and Deception:</strong> You will not use the
                            Service to impersonate any person or entity, or to misrepresent your affiliation with a
                            person
                            or entity. You will not engage in fraudulent activities, such as attempting to scam others,
                            conducting phishing schemes, or manipulating the Service's outputs to deceive someone (e.g.,
                            deepfakes intended to defraud). If the Service's AI generates content that could be mistaken
                            for factual information (like a realistic news article), you agree to use such output
                            responsibly and not to mislead others that the AI-generated content is a verified truth.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Objectionable Content:</strong> In addition to the
                            above,
                            you will refrain from using the Service to create content that is extremely graphic or
                            violent
                            (especially if it glorifies suffering), excessively profane, or otherwise objectionable such
                            that it would make the Service hostile to other users. While creative freedom is important,
                            please use good judgment and refrain from pushing the AI to produce the worst forms of
                            content. If you encounter any content or behavior that violates these rules, you can report
                            it to us. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to monitor and moderate content and
                            to remove or restrict any content that violates these Terms or applicable law.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Moderation and Enforcement:</strong> We may (at our
                            discretion) monitor user activity and content on the Service to ensure compliance with these
                            Terms and to maintain a safe environment. If you violate the above rules or any other
                            provision of these Terms, we may take action including warning you, removing or disabling
                            access to offending content, suspending or terminating your account, and/or reporting you to
                            law enforcement if the activity is unlawful. We are not required to provide advance notice
                            before taking action to remove content or suspend an account, especially if we determine
                            that
                            the violation is serious or poses risk. However, we will endeavor to act fairly and, where
                            appropriate, will notify you of the violation and give you a chance to respond or remedy the
                            issue. Remember that your use of the Service is a privilege, not a right, and that privilege
                            can be revoked if abused.</p>

                            Your Content</h4>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain any ownership rights that
                            you have in the content you create, submit, or upload to the Service ("User Content"). We do
                            not claim ownership over your original works. For example, your photos, videos, artwork, or
                            text that you upload remain yours. However, by using the Service and providing User Content,
                            you grant Parthenius AI Studio a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable
                            license
                            to use, reproduce, modify (for technical processing purposes, e.g. converting a file
                            format),
                            display, and distribute your User Content solely as necessary to operate and provide the
                            Service. This means, for instance, we have your permission to process your images through
                            our
                            AI models to generate outputs, to display your content back to you, to create backups, or to
                            transmit it to third-party processors (like those mentioned in our Privacy Policy) that help
                            provide the functionality. We will not use your User Content for any purpose other than
                            delivering the service to you (and improving that service), unless you give us additional
                            permission.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            You represent and warrant that you have all the rights in any User Content that are
                            necessary for you to grant the license above, and that our use of your User Content in
                            accordance with these Terms will not violate any law or infringe any third-party rights. In
                            plain language: you promise that either you created the content yourself or you have
                            obtained
                            the proper rights/consents to use it and allow us to use it for providing the Service.

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>AI Processing of Your Content:</strong> When you input
                            or upload content to use our AI features (for example, uploading a photo or video to have
                            the
                            AI modify it, or entering text for the AI to generate an image), you understand that the
                            content may be processed by our algorithms and possibly sent to third-party AI providers as
                            described in our Privacy Policy. We do not use content you input to train our public models
                            or improve the Service for others without your permission (for instance, we are not feeding
                            your personal photos into a public dataset). The AI may temporarily analyze and transform
                            your content to produce the result, but those processing steps are ephemeral and for your
                            use. We might internally analyze usage of features in aggregate to improve our services,
                            but we are not examining your personal content beyond what is necessary to deliver the
                            output.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Content Storage:</strong> As explained in our Privacy
                            Policy, we primarily store your content locally on your device. The Service may also cache
                            or
                            store your content on our servers in a limited way (e.g., text prompts or low-resolution
                            preview images might be logged for a short time). By providing your content, you acknowledge
                            and agree that we may store and transmit it as needed to provide the Service, but we do not
                            intend to keep your content longer than necessary. We are not a cloud backup service –
                            please
                            ensure you have copies of your important content, as we are not liable for loss of content
                            (see Limitation of Liability below).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Public Sharing:</strong> Currently, our Service does
                            not automatically publish your content for others to see (unless you explicitly share it).
                            If in the future we introduce any community features (like a gallery of user creations), we
                            will provide you with settings to control what content you share publicly. By default,
                            assume
                            your content remains private to you and those you choose to share it with (if any). If you
                            choose to share or make public any content through our Service, you grant us the additional
                            right to display and distribute that content to others as needed to effectuate the sharing.
                            You also give other users of the Service a right to view and (if explicitly allowed by you)
                            use your publicly shared content within the Service's functionality.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We reserve the right to remove or disable any User Content from the Service that violates
                            these Terms or that we deem necessary to remove for legal or safety reasons. However, we do
                            not routinely pre-screen content, and you acknowledge that you may encounter content from
                            other users that is inappropriate or offensive. Parthenius AI Studio is not responsible for
                            the content users create or share via the Service.
                        </p>

                            AI-Generated Content (Outputs)</h4>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Ownership of AI Outputs:</strong> To the extent
                            permitted
                            by applicable law, Parthenius AI Studio makes no claim of ownership over the outputs that
                            you
                            generate using the Service. Our intention is that you should be able to use and enjoy the
                            content you create. However, because the content is generated by an algorithm, the concept
                            of
                            "ownership" can be complicated. By default, we assign to you any rights we can in the output
                            for your own use. This means you are free to download, use, edit, and share the outputs you
                            create, for personal or commercial purposes, provided that such use does not violate any
                            other part of these Terms or any law. We effectively grant you a license to the output
                            content that is as broad as we can give (since in many jurisdictions, AI-generated content
                            might not be subject to traditional copyright, consider this a transfer of whatever
                            copyright
                            or database rights we may have in the output, to you). You do not owe us royalties for
                            legitimate use of your outputs.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Limitations:</strong> The above statement
                            notwithstanding,
                            some outputs may not be entirely yours to own. The AI may produce content that is similar to
                            existing works or includes elements (like a famous character's likeness, or text from a
                            copyrighted source) that could be subject to third-party rights. We do not guarantee that
                            the
                            outputs are unique or free of third-party intellectual property. For example, if you ask the
                            AI to generate an image of Mickey Mouse, the output likely infringes Disney's IP; you would
                            not have the right to commercially use that. You are responsible for ensuring that your use
                            of
                            any AI-generated content complies with applicable laws and does not infringe others' rights.
                            Parthenius AI Studio is not liable if you generate content that infringes someone else's
                            rights, and you agree to indemnify us for any claims arising from your use of outputs (see
                            Indemnification section).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Use of Outputs:</strong> You agree not to remove any
                            proprietary notices (if any) in the outputs or to falsely claim that the AI-generated
                            content
                            was human-created. For instance, if we watermark certain AI outputs or display an indicator
                            that an image was AI-generated, you should not tamper with that if the terms or law require
                            disclosure. Some jurisdictions are considering laws requiring AI content disclosure; you are
                            responsible for adhering to such laws where applicable. We encourage ethical use: if you
                            publish AI-generated content, it's good practice to be transparent that it was AI-assisted,
                            especially for sensitive or factual content.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Our License to Outputs:</strong> While we do not claim
                            ownership of your outputs, by using the Service you agree that Parthenius AI Studio may
                            retain
                            and use copies of outputs for the limited purpose of operating or improving the Service, in
                            accordance with our Privacy Policy. For example, we might store recent outputs to show you
                            your usage history, or to run quality checks or algorithm improvements (in which case we
                            would anonymize them and not associate them with your personal information). We will not
                            resell or publicly display your outputs without your permission. However, we may internally
                            analyze outputs (along with inputs) to refine our AI models or features – in such cases, we
                            ensure this data is handled securely and in aggregated form. If we ever wanted to showcase
                            some user-generated outputs for marketing (e.g., featuring cool user creations on our
                            website), we would ask for your consent.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            In summary: we aim for you to feel confident using and sharing the cool things you create
                            with Parthenius AI Studio. Just remember that certain content might carry restrictions
                            (especially if it depicts real people, brands, or artwork), and you should use outputs
                            responsibly. Use them at your own risk in terms of legal liability – we cannot provide an
                            absolute guarantee on the legal status of AI outputs, given the evolving laws and the
                            unpredictability of the AI models.

                            an
                            innovative AI service, but it comes with uncertainties. The AI-generated content, by its
                            nature, may be unpredictable, inaccurate, or inappropriate at times. We need to make clear
                            that your use of the Service and any content obtained through it is at your sole risk. The

                            leverages AI models (some developed by third parties) to generate content based on user
                            inputs. These AI outputs are inherently probabilistic and may contain errors, inaccuracies,
                            or
                            content that you find inappropriate or biased. We do not guarantee the quality, correctness,
                            or reliability of any output. You accept and agree that any use of outputs from our Service
                            is
                            at your sole risk, and you will not rely on the output as a sole source of truth or factual
                            information, or as a substitute for professional advice. For example, any health, legal, or
                            financial information generated by the AI should be verified by a qualified professional
                            before you act on it. The AI might also produce content that is fictional but presented in
                            a realistic manner – you are responsible for critically evaluating the output. We strongly
                            recommend that you review and vet all AI-generated content (especially before sharing or
                            using it publicly). You should not input highly sensitive or confidential information into
                            the
                            AI features, because while we take precautions to protect data, the very act of generating
                            outputs means information is processed in a way that could produce unintended results.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>No Guarantee of Continuous Availability:</strong> The
                            Service might undergo maintenance, experience technical issues, or require updates that make
                            it

                            third-party integrations might be modified or discontinued. We reserve the right to suspend
                            or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, without notice, as needed for

                            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above

                            limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                            Limitation of Liability</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Limitation on Types of Damages:</strong> To the maximum
                            extent permitted by applicable law, Parthenius AI Studio (Generative AI Teknoloji A.Ş.) and
                            its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and licensors will not be liable to
                            you
                            for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages whatsoever,
                            including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill,
                            business interruption, or other intangible losses, arising out of or related to your access
                            to
                            or use of (or inability to use) the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility
                            of such damages. This exclusion applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract,
                            tort, negligence, strict liability, statutory, or otherwise). In plain language, if
                            something
                            goes wrong or the Service doesn't work as expected, we are not responsible for the myriad
                            consequences that might indirectly result, like you missing out on a business opportunity or
                            your device getting damaged by downloading content (to the extent we didn't directly cause
                            it).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Liability Cap:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted
                            by law, our total aggregate liability for all claims arising from or related to the Service
                            or
                            these Terms will not exceed the amount that you paid us, if any, for access to the Service
                            in
                            the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the liability. If you have not
                            paid us anything (as is the case for free users), our total liability shall not exceed US
                            $100 (or equivalent in local currency). This limitation applies collectively to us and our
                            affiliates and suppliers. The existence of multiple claims or suits under or related to
                            these
                            Terms will not enlarge or extend the cap.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Nothing in these Terms is intended
                            to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under law. In particular, if
                            applicable
                            law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion/limitation of
                            certain damages, those provisions will not apply to you to the extent disallowed. For
                            example,
                            some countries do not allow limiting liability for death or personal injury caused by
                            negligence, or for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Also, the above limitations do
                            not
                            apply to liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or intentional misconduct to the
                            extent that such liability cannot be limited by law.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Additionally, if you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that affords you certain rights, you
                            might be entitled to remedies beyond those set forth above. These Terms do not affect any
                            rights you may have under mandatory consumer protection laws.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Allocation of Risk:</strong> You acknowledge and agree
                            that the disclaimers and limitations of liability in these Terms are an essential basis of
                            the
                            bargain between you and Parthenius AI Studio, and that absent such disclaimers and
                            limitations, the terms and fees (if any) would be different. You specifically acknowledge
                            that we would not be able to offer the Service on economically feasible terms without these
                            limitations.</p>

                            Suspension and Termination</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>By You:</strong> You are free to stop using the Service
                            at any time. You may delete your account through the app (if that functionality exists) or
                            by
                            contacting us at support. Deleting your account will typically result in the deactivation or
                            deletion of your profile and associated personal data, as described in our Privacy Policy.
                            If
                            you just stop using the Service without deleting your account, we may eventually close your
                            account due to prolonged inactivity (but we will try to warn you first).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>By Us:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or
                            terminate your access to the Service (in whole or in part) under the following
                            circumstances:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>For Cause (Violations):</strong> If you violate
                                these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or any other policies applicable to the Service; or if
                                you infringe third-party rights or engage in behavior that is unlawful, abusive, or that
                                harms the community or our brand, we may suspend your account or terminate your use of
                                the Service. Depending on the severity, this might be immediate or after a notice and
                                opportunity to cure (if feasible). We may also suspend/terminate if we are required to
                                do so by law or at the request of law enforcement, or if your use of the Service poses a
                                security risk or could subject us to liability. For example, if you are found using the
                                Service to operate a hate campaign or to spam others, we will likely ban you outright.
                            </li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>For Inactivity or Maintenance:</strong> We may
                                terminate accounts that have been inactive for an extended period (e.g., if you haven't
                                logged in for a year) to free up resources, but we will try to email you beforehand.
                                Also,
                                from time to time, we might suspend the Service for maintenance or discontinue certain
                                features – in such cases, we try to minimize disruption.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Service Termination:</strong> We hope to continue
                            offering Parthenius AI Studio well into the future, but if for some reason we need to
                            discontinue the Service entirely, we may terminate all user accounts with reasonable notice.
                            This could happen, for instance, if our company ceases operations, merges, or if providing
                            the
                            Service is no longer viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you via the email on
                            your account or through the Service interface if such a broad termination occurs.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination of
                            your
                            account or access, whether terminated by you or us, your right to use the Service will
                            immediately cease. We will close your account and you will lose access to any data in the
                            account (so make sure to back up anything you need beforehand). However, certain provisions
                            of
                            these Terms will survive termination. These include (but are not limited to) provisions on
                            Intellectual Property, Disclaimers of Warranty, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification,
                            Governing Law & Dispute Resolution, and Miscellaneous. Any licenses you granted to us in
                            User
                            Content remain in effect for content we retained (for instance, if some of your outputs were
                            used for improving our AI, our rights to that data survive, though remember we don't use
                            personal data after account deletion except as necessary).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            If your account was terminated due to a breach of Terms, you may not create a new account or
                            access the Service without our express permission. We reserve the right to refuse service to
                            anyone for any lawful reason, particularly to protect our platform and users.

                            Modifications to the Service and Terms</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Service Changes:</strong> The field of AI is rapidly
                            evolving, and so is our Service. We may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes,
                            updates, upgrades, or other modifications to improve performance or add features (or remove
                            features that are no longer feasible). We reserve the right to deploy such changes at any
                            time.
                            We also reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service (or the
                            entire Service), either temporarily or permanently, with or without notice. For example, we
                            might change the models available, impose new limits on free usage, or discontinue support
                            for a particular operating system. While we will do our best to keep users informed and
                            maintain compatibility, such changes might affect how you use the Service or the content you
                            have stored. You agree that we are not liable for any modification, suspension, or
                            discontinuation of the Service.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Terms Changes:</strong> We may revise these Terms from
                            time to time, for example to reflect changes to the Service or for legal, regulatory, or
                            security reasons. If we make material changes, we will give you reasonable notice, either by
                            email to the address associated with your account, by posting a notice within the Service,
                            or
                            by updating the date at the top of the Terms and providing a prominent highlight of changes.
                            The updated Terms will be effective on the date stated in the notice (or if no date is
                            stated, when posted). By continuing to use the Service after the new Terms take effect, you
                            agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop
                            using the Service and, if applicable, cancel any subscription and/or delete your account. We
                            encourage you to review the Terms periodically to ensure you understand the latest terms and
                            conditions of use.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Please note that any dispute arising before changes to the Terms will be governed by the
                            Terms
                            in effect at the time the dispute arose.

                            Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Governing Law:</strong> These Terms and any action
                            related to them or the Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
                            of the Republic of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. If you are a
                            consumer resident in the EU or another jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws,
                            you may benefit from any mandatory provisions of law applicable in your country of
                            residence,
                            and nothing in this governing law section affects your rights as such.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong> Please read the
                            following section carefully, as it requires you to arbitrate disputes with Parthenius AI
                            Studio
                            and limits the manner in which you can seek relief.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution:</strong> We aim to resolve
                            concerns quickly and to the mutual satisfaction of our users. You agree to first attempt to
                            resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
                            Service (collectively, "Disputes") informally by contacting us at support@parthenius.ai.
                            Most
                            issues can be resolved without formal proceedings. If a Dispute cannot be resolved within 30
                            days of your submission (or such longer time as we may agree), then either party may
                            initiate
                            the arbitration process outlined below.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> Except for the exceptions
                            below, you and Parthenius AI Studio agree that all Disputes (including questions regarding
                            the
                            breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms) shall be
                            finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by an independent arbitration
                            institution.
                            If you reside in Türkiye or anywhere outside the United States, the arbitration will be
                            administered by the Istanbul Arbitration Centre (ISTAC) under its applicable rules (or a
                            similar reputable arbitration body chosen by us). If you reside in the United States, the
                            arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its
                            Consumer Arbitration Rules. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be decided by a neutral
                            arbitrator, not a judge or jury, and that the proceedings and outcome remain private. You
                            agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Parthenius AI Studio are each waiving the
                            right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action for covered
                            Disputes.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong> The arbitration shall
                            be
                            conducted by a single arbitrator. The language of arbitration will be English (unless both
                            parties agree to proceed in Turkish, for example). The arbitration venue shall be Istanbul,
                            Turkey, or, if you prefer and if you are an individual using the Service for personal use,
                            you may choose to have the arbitration conducted remotely or in your home country (subject
                            to
                            the arbitrator's approval). The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
                            jurisdiction could award, including individual injunctive relief and attorneys' fees when
                            authorized by law. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, and judgment on the
                            award
                            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing
                            arbitration agreement, either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court
                            (if
                            the claim qualifies and so long as it remains on an individual, non-class basis).
                            Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of law in
                            order
                            to prevent (on a temporary or preliminary basis) an actual or threatened infringement,
                            misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.
                            Such
                            request for injunctive relief shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to
                            arbitrate
                            or as a waiver of that agreement.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Opt-Out Right:</strong> If you do not wish to be bound
                            by the arbitration provision, you must notify us by email at legal@parthenius.ai within 30
                            days of first accepting these Terms, stating that you opt out of the arbitration agreement.
                            If
                            you opt out, or in the event the arbitration agreement is deemed unenforceable or not
                            applicable, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the
                            "Jurisdiction"
                            section below shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> To the maximum extent
                            permitted by law, you and Parthenius AI Studio agree that each may bring claims against the
                            other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
                            purported class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall not consolidate or join
                            more
                            than one person's or entity's claims and shall not otherwise preside over any form of a
                            representative or class proceeding. If this class-action waiver is found to be
                            unenforceable,
                            then the entirety of the arbitration section will be null and void and, in that case, you
                            and
                            Parthenius AI Studio agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the
                            "Jurisdiction" section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these
                            Terms.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Subject to the above arbitration
                            agreement, you and Parthenius AI Studio agree that any judicial proceedings (if any) will be
                            brought in, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, the courts of İstanbul,
                            Turkey.
                            You waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. If you reside outside of
                            Turkey, we both agree to waive any rights to a trial by jury, if applicable in your
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Limitation on Claims:</strong> To the extent permitted
                            by law, any Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the
                            claim knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim. If a claim is not
                            filed
                            within this time, it is permanently barred.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (together with
                            the
                            Privacy Policy and any additional guidelines, terms, or rules that we post in relation to
                            specific services or features, which are incorporated by reference) constitute the entire
                            agreement between you and Parthenius AI Studio regarding the Service, and supersede all
                            prior
                            agreements, proposals, negotiations, and communications (whether written or oral) relating
                            to
                            the Service. Any additional or different terms in any purchase order or other written
                            correspondence from you are void, unless expressly agreed in writing by an authorized
                            representative of Parthenius AI Studio.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or
                            provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right
                            or
                            provision. Likewise, the waiver of any breach or default under these Terms will not
                            constitute
                            a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. To be legally binding, any waiver by
                            Parthenius
                            AI Studio of any provision of these Terms must be in writing (which could include a
                            statement
                            via email).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms
                            is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent
                            jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the
                            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The invalid
                            provision
                            will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy the invalidity while
                            retaining
                            as much of the parties' original intent as possible. If such modification is not possible,
                            the
                            provision will be severed, and the rest of the Terms will continue unaffected.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer
                            these
                            Terms (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent.
                            Any
                            attempt to do so without consent will be null and void. We may freely assign or transfer our
                            rights and obligations under these Terms to any third party as part of a merger,
                            acquisition,
                            sale of business or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms will bind and
                            inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms are
                            for the benefit of you and Parthenius AI Studio, and not for any other person. No third
                            party
                            shall have any rights to enforce any term of these Terms, except as expressly provided in
                            these Terms (for example, indemnified parties under the Indemnification section).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Relationship of the Parties:</strong> You and Parthenius
                            AI Studio are independent contracting parties. These Terms do not create a partnership,
                            franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties.
                            Neither party has the authority to make any commitments on behalf of the other.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Notices:</strong> We may provide notices or
                            communications to you through the Service (e.g., in-app notifications), via email to the
                            address in your account, or by other means. You are responsible for keeping your contact
                            information up-to-date. Official legal notices to us must be sent to our registered address
                            (see Privacy Policy Contact section) with a copy to legal@parthenius.ai. Email notices are
                            deemed received 24 hours after they are sent, unless the sender is notified that the email
                            address is invalid. Postal notices are deemed received when signed for as delivered (or when
                            delivery is refused).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Neither we nor you will be
                            liable for any delay or failure in performance (excluding payment obligations) due to
                            circumstances beyond our reasonable control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, civil
                            disturbances, strikes, supply chain disruptions, internet or utility failures, pandemics, or
                            government actions. However, this does not excuse you from paying any fees owed. We will
                            each
                            use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of a force majeure event and resume full
                            performance as soon as feasible.</p>
