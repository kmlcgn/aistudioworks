                            long-term, deeply creative and useful AI-driven experiences for individual creators and
                            businesses alike. If you're looking to join a fast-moving, product-driven team and build

                        <h2
                            style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 400;">
                            What You'll Do</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Research the Market & Competitors:</strong> Identify and
                            map out competing apps and tools in the AI, creative, and productivity space. Document their
                            features, pricing, positioning, and strengths/weaknesses. Create simple comparison overviews
                            (e.g. tables, slide decks, or Notion pages) to share insights with the team.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Generate and Structure New Feature Ideas:</strong>
                            Brainstorm ideas for new features and improvements to our web and iOS apps. Turn raw ideas
                            into structured concepts by outlining the problem, proposed solution, target user, and
                            expected value. Prepare short concept documents that the team can quickly understand and
                            discuss.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Help "Architect" Features:</strong> Contribute to
                            defining how new features should work. Support the writing of basic user stories and user
                            flows (for example, "As a user I want to do X so that Y…"). Sketch simple screen wireframes
                            or flows (even hand-drawn or using basic tools) to illustrate ideas. Think through edge
                            cases and UX details together with the team to ensure a smooth user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Collect and Organize User Insights:</strong> Gather user
                            feedback from various sources like app store reviews, customer support conversations, and
                            surveys. Tag and summarize recurring themes, pain points, and feature requests. Maintain a
                            simple idea backlog (e.g. in Notion or a spreadsheet) and help keep it organized and
                            prioritized.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Support Roadmap & Prioritization:</strong> Assist in
                            evaluating which features or improvements should be tackled next. Help prepare lightweight
                            prioritization matrices (e.g. impact vs. effort) and contribute to internal discussions on
                            what goes into the next roadmap. You might also help create small internal presentations or
                            briefs for upcoming feature proposals.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Learn How Product Is Built:</strong> Join product
                            discussions and planning calls to observe and contribute. See firsthand how design and
                            development teams turn specs into real, working features. Over time, you'll gain a deep
                            understanding of our product development process and the lifecycle of bringing an idea from
                            concept to release.</p>

                        <h2
                            style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 400;">
                            What We're Looking For</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Early-Career Experience:</strong> You are early in your
                            product career (perhaps a recent graduate or with 1–2 years of experience in a relevant
                            role). You have a Bachelor's or Master's background in fields like Business, Economics,
                            Computer Science, Design, Data Science, Engineering, or similar. Importantly, you've had
                            some hands-on exposure to product development or tech projects – for example through an
                            internship, a part-time job, or significant academic projects. (This is not an introductory
                            student internship; some real-world experience is expected.)
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Strong interest in Product & Tech:</strong> You are
                            genuinely curious about how digital products are built and improved. You stay informed about
                            tech trends and enjoy trying out new apps or AI tools. Excitement about the AI/creative
                            tools space is a big plus – you have enthusiasm to learn about generative AI products and
                            their capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Analytical & Organized:</strong> You enjoy researching
                            and comparing information, and you have a knack for structuring your findings clearly.
                            Instead of getting lost in notes, you can distill insights into clear summaries or simple
                            reports. You're comfortable working with data (e.g. survey results or usage metrics) to draw
                            conclusions, and you pay attention to detail when organizing information (lists, tables,
                            backlog items, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Good Communication (English):</strong> You can read and
                            write confidently in English, since it's our working language. You're able to express ideas
                            clearly in writing – whether it's a concept note, an email, or a chat message. In meetings
                            or calls, you aren't afraid to speak up to ask questions or share thoughts. (Don't worry, we
                            don't expect perfect grammar at all times – but clarity and willingness to communicate are
                            key.)
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Proactive & Eager to Learn:</strong> We value someone
                            who takes initiative. You ask questions when you don't understand something, rather than
                            staying silent. When you have an idea to improve the product, you're excited to bring it up.
                            You can take ownership of small tasks and drive them to completion. In short, you have a
                            self-starter attitude – you seek out learning opportunities and are not afraid to step
                            outside your comfort zone to grow.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 600;">
                            Nice-to-Haves (Not Required)</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Tool Familiarity:</strong> Experience with productivity
                            and design tools such as Notion (for documentation/project management), Figma or Sketch (for
                            design and wireframing), Miro or Trello (for brainstorming and workflows) is a plus. Being
                            comfortable with these or similar tools will help you ramp up faster, but they are not
                            strict requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Side Projects or Competitions:</strong> If you have
                            participated in hackathons, case competitions, coding/design bootcamps, or have built your
                            own side projects, that's a bonus. We love to see practical passion – whether it's a small
                            app you launched, a school project you took pride in, or a competition where you applied
                            product thinking. These experiences aren't required, but they show us your curiosity and
                            initiative beyond coursework or jobs.</p>

                        <h2
                            style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 400;">
                            Working Conditions & Compensation</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Hours:</strong> Part-time, approximately 15–20 hours per
                            week. We offer a flexible schedule – you can distribute your hours across the week in a way
                            that fits your life (we're results-oriented and understand you might have other
                            commitments). We only ask that you can be available for key team calls or meetings as
                            needed.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Location:</strong> 100% remote. You can work from
                            anywhere, as long as you have a reliable internet connection and can collaborate with the
                            team online. Our team is distributed, so we are used to async communication and remote
                            collaboration tools.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Contract:</strong> This is a freelance/contract-based
                            position, part-time. The initial contract will be for 3–6 months (working-student style
                            engagement), with the possibility to extend longer if it's a great fit on both sides. (Note:
                            This is not a formal internship; it's a junior contributor role with real responsibilities.)
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Compensation:</strong> 40,000 TL net per month, paid
                            monthly. This is the take-home pay for the part-time hours (approximately 15–20 hours/week).
                            As a contractor, you will be responsible for your own tax and insurance arrangements, but we
                            can guide you if you have questions about that. Payment will be via bank transfer at the end
                            of each month.</p>

                            Why Join Parthenius AI Studio</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Accelerate Your Growth:</strong> This role gives you
                            hands-on product management experience and responsibility early in your career. You won't be
                            fetching coffee or doing busywork – your research and ideas will directly influence real
                            product decisions. It's a chance to build skills faster than in a typical entry-level job.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Full Product Lifecycle Exposure:</strong> You will
                            witness and take part in the entire journey of product development. From the spark of an
                            idea in a brainstorming doc, to researching its feasibility, to writing specs, and finally
                            seeing the feature implemented in the app – you'll get to see it all. This holistic view of
                            how ideas become live features is an invaluable learning experience for an aspiring product
                            manager.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Close-Knit Team & Mentorship:</strong> You'll be working
                            closely with the founders and the core product team. This means you'll get direct mentorship
                            and feedback, and your contributions will be visible. You won't be just a tiny cog in a big
                            machine; instead, you'll have a seat at the table in discussions and your work will matter.
                            It's a supportive environment where questions are encouraged, and learning is part of the
                            daily routine.
