                            Introduction</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Welcome to Parthenius AI Studio. This Privacy Policy describes how Parthenius AI Studio
                            (operated by Generative AI Teknoloji Anonim Şirketi) collects, uses, and safeguards your
                            personal data when you use our mobile and web AI products and services ("Service"). We are a
                            global company and are committed to protecting your privacy in compliance with applicable
                            laws (including EU GDPR, UK Data Protection Act, California CCPA, Turkish KVKK, and other
                            relevant regulations). By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of
                            information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue
                            use of the Service.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently, only for the purposes
                            explained
                            below. We do not use your data for any purpose that is incompatible with those purposes. In
                            this Policy, "we" or "us" refers to Generative AI Teknoloji A.Ş. (trading as Parthenius AI
                            Studio), and "you" refers to the user of our Service.

                            Information We Collect</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We collect personal information and other data to provide and improve our Service. The types
                            of information we may collect include:
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Information you provide when
                            creating an account or interacting with us, such as your name, email address, username,
                            password, and contact details. We may also collect account profile details or preferences if
                            you choose to provide them.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>User Content:</strong> Any content you submit or
                            generate through the Service, such as images, videos, text prompts, or other media. For
                            example, if you use our AI Studio to create videos or images, the input content (photos,
                            video clips, etc.) and the AI-generated outputs may be considered user content. Note: Most
                            user-generated content (especially large media files like images or videos) is stored
                            locally
                            on your own device by default – our servers only process it temporarily to facilitate the AI
                            generation and do not permanently store these files. We regularly delete any temporary
                            copies
                            from our servers once processing is complete.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you access
                            and use the Service. This can include your interactions with the app or website (e.g.
                            features used, buttons clicked, pages viewed), timestamps and logs of usage, preferences,
                            and
                            crash reports. We also collect technical data sent by your device, such as your device type,
                            operating system version, unique device identifiers, IP address, browser type, and other
                            system information. Usage Data may also include broad location information inferred from
                            your
                            IP address or device settings (e.g. city or country), as well as location information if you
                            grant the app permission (for example, if a feature requires GPS-based location, we will
                            only
                            collect it with your consent).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you make purchases
                            or subscribe to paid features, we (through our payment processor) collect payment
                            information
                            such as your credit/debit card number, expiration date, billing address, and transaction
                            details. Note: Payment transactions are handled by third-party processor Stripe (or another
                            listed payment provider) on our behalf. We do not receive or store your full financial
                            account numbers; we only receive limited information such as a payment confirmation, masked
                            card digits, and subscription status needed for record-keeping.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We may also receive information from third-party sources if you link or integrate other
                            services with Parthenius AI Studio. For instance, if you log in via a third-party platform
                            or use an API integration, that provider may send us certain information (according to their
                            privacy settings and policies).
                        </p>

                        <h3
                            style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 400;">
                            How We Use Your Information</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We use
                            personal data to allow you to register and authenticate your account, and to provide the
                            core
                            features of our AI Studio. For example, we use your information to generate AI content based
                            on your inputs, to save your projects or preferences, and to deliver the functionality you
                            expect. We also use contact details (like your email) to send necessary communications, such
                            as account confirmations, transactional notifications (e.g. purchase receipts), important
                            service announcements, or support responses.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Improve and Develop the Service:</strong> We process
                            usage data and feedback to understand how our Service is used and to make improvements. This
                            includes fixing bugs, monitoring performance, optimizing algorithms, and developing new
                            features. For instance, we may analyze aggregate usage patterns to improve user interface
                            design or to ensure the AI models are performing efficiently. We may also use crash logs or
                            error reports to troubleshoot and enhance stability.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Personalization:</strong> To the extent permitted, we
                            may use certain data to personalize your experience. For example, remembering your
                            preferences, interface settings, or past content can help tailor the Service to you. Any
                            such profiling or personalization will be done in line with applicable laws and, where
                            required, with your consent.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Payments and Transactions:</strong> We use payment and
                            contact information to process your purchases or subscription fees. This includes charging
                            your payment method through our payment processor (e.g. Stripe) and keeping a record of your
                            transactions. We may also use this info to detect and prevent fraudulent payments or abuse
                            of
                            our payment system.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Communicate with You:</strong> We use your contact
                            information (such as email) to send service-related communications. These include
                            verification emails, password reset instructions, subscription or billing notices, updates
                            to our policies, or customer support replies. If you opt in to receive marketing
                            communications or newsletters, we will use your email to send you promotional content about
                            new features or offers – and you can opt out at any time. We will not spam you, and will
                            send marketing messages only in accordance with your preferences and applicable law.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Security and Abuse Prevention:</strong> We process
                            certain data (like IP address, device info, and usage logs) to monitor for suspicious or
                            malicious activity and to enforce our Terms of Service. This helps us to protect the
                            integrity of our platform, investigate potential fraud, hacking or abuse, and ensure users
                            are not violating usage policies. For example, we may use automated tools to flag unusual
                            usage patterns that could indicate bots or misuse, and we may log account actions in case we
                            need to audit or investigate improper behavior.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Where necessary, we use and
                            retain your information to comply with legal obligations applicable to us. For instance, we
                            may keep transaction records for tax and accounting purposes, or we may process personal
                            data
                            to comply with lawful requests by public authorities. If we are under a legal duty to
                            disclose data (e.g. a court order or subpoena), or to enforce our agreements or protect our
                            rights, we will use and share data as needed (see Data Sharing below).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Other Purposes with Consent:</strong> If we intend to
                            use your data for any purpose not outlined in this Policy, we will explain it to you at the
                            time of collection or request your consent. We will not use sensitive personal data for
                            purposes you have not agreed to.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We limit our use of personal data to what is relevant and necessary for each purpose. We do
                            not use your personal data for automated decisions that produce legal or similarly
                            significant effects on you without human review (for example, no fully automated account
                            termination without oversight).
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Parthenius AI Studio relies on a number of trusted third-party service providers to operate
                            our Service. These third parties process data on our behalf for specific business purposes,
                            such as hosting, analytics, payment processing, and AI computing. We never sell your
                            personal data to third parties. We only share data with these providers to the extent
                            necessary to deliver our Service, under strict obligations of confidentiality and security.
                            The key third-party services we use (and the data they handle) include:

                            events, and crash logs to help us diagnose issues and understand user engagement. Analytics
                            data collected via Firebase is generally aggregated and does not directly identify you.
                            (Google may set its own analytics cookies or identifiers in our app/website, which operate
                            under Google's Privacy Policy.) We also use Firebase Authentication services if applicable
                            for
                            secure login, and Firebase Cloud Storage/Firestore to store minimal data (excluding your
                            personal media files, which remain on your device unless otherwise stated).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Google Cloud Platform:</strong> Our servers and backend
                            services are hosted on Google Cloud's data centers. Therefore, any personal data that is
                            stored or processed by our backend (such as account information, text prompts, or temporary
                            caches of AI generation data) may pass through Google Cloud servers. Google Cloud acts as
                            our data processor, storing data securely and allowing us to scale our Service globally.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Stripe:</strong> We integrate Stripe, Inc. as our
                            payment
                            processor for handling subscription fees or other payments. When you enter your payment
                            details, that information is sent directly to Stripe via secure TLS encryption; we do not
                            see
                            or store your full credit card number or CVV code. Stripe processes your payment and then
                            provides us with a confirmation and limited information (such as the last four digits of
                            your
                            card, card type, expiration, and a payment token). Stripe is a PCI-DSS compliant service.
                            Please review Stripe's privacy policy for details on their data handling. We have a contract
                            with Stripe ensuring that they protect your data and only use it for payment processing on
                            our behalf.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Our AI Studio may utilize language or
                            image generation models from OpenAI (e.g., GPT APIs or DALL·E) to provide some of the
                            AI-generated content features. If you enter text prompts or other content to be processed by
                            an OpenAI model, those inputs may be sent to OpenAI's servers and the AI-generated output is
                            returned to our app. We do not use OpenAI's services to process any personal data beyond
                            what you input for generation, and we do not store your prompts or outputs on our servers
                            longer than necessary. (OpenAI's API policies state that they do not use API data to improve
                            their models by default, and they have their own data retention rules.) Nonetheless, your
                            use
                            of such features is subject to OpenAI's terms and privacy policy as well, and by using them
                            you consent to OpenAI processing your data for the purpose of providing the AI output. We
                            will clearly indicate when an AI feature is powered by a third-party model like OpenAI.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Fal.ai and Eachlabs:</strong> We partner with Fal.ai
                            (a generative AI model hosting platform) and Eachlabs (AI workflow provider) to run certain
                            AI models (for image, video, or other media generation) more efficiently. When you request
                            an AI generation that uses one of these providers, your input data (such as an image or text
                            prompt) is securely transmitted to their servers which run the model and return the result.
                            We do not permanently store your input or the resulting output on our own servers, but these
                            third-party AI providers may momentarily cache data for processing or performance. We
                            contractually require that any data sent to these AI providers is used only to fulfill your
                            requested generation and not retained longer than necessary or used for other purposes.
                            However, as with OpenAI, use of these services means your data will be processed by them
                            under their privacy practices. We recommend reviewing Fal.ai's and Eachlabs' privacy
                            policies for more information.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Other Service Providers:</strong> We may use
                            additional third parties for specific functionalities: for example, email delivery services
                            (to send you verification or support emails), customer support platforms (to manage support
                            tickets or chats), or analytics and tracking tools (such as Google Analytics or similar, if
                            integrated into our website). Any such providers will be limited to accessing the data
                            needed to perform their tasks (e.g. your email address for an email service, or anonymized
                            usage data for analytics). Where required, we will ask your consent for certain analytics or
                            marketing cookies.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We ensure all third-party processors we engage are bound by contractual agreements to
                            protect
                            your data and to use it only for the purposes we specify. They must implement
                            industry-standard security measures and comply with applicable privacy laws. We remain
                            responsible for the handling of your personal data by all such third parties acting on our
                            behalf. Aside from these processors, we will not share your personal data with any other
                            third parties for their own marketing or other independent use without your consent.

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Service Providers:</strong> As detailed above, we share
                            data with vendors and processors who need it to perform functions on our behalf (hosting,
                            payments, AI processing, etc.). They are not permitted to use your data for any purpose
                            other
                            than providing services to us, in line with this Policy. We do not sell or rent your

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your
                            information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public
                            authorities (e.g., a court, regulatory agency, or law enforcement subpoena). We will only
                            share the data necessary and will object to overbroad requests when appropriate.
                            Additionally,
                            if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
                            or others' safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, we may do so. For
                            example, we may share data to investigate or prevent actual or suspected illegal activities,
                            security issues, or violations of our Terms of Service.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Parthenius AI Studio
                            (Generative AI Teknoloji A.Ş.) is involved in a merger, acquisition, investment, financing,
                            reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or part of its assets, your personal data may be
                            transferred to the successor or acquiring entity as part of that transaction. We will

                            this Policy. You will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our website of any
                            change in ownership or uses of your personal information.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your personal
                            data with third parties in other ways if you explicitly ask or consent for us to do so. For
                            instance, if you opt-in to a feature that involves sharing data with an external partner, or
                            you enter a promotion that involves an outside sponsor, we will clarify how your data will
                            be shared and seek your permission.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We may also share aggregated or de-identified information (which cannot reasonably identify
                            you) publicly or with partners – for example, publishing usage statistics or training
                            machine learning models on anonymized data. This information will not include any personal
                            details.

                            Aside from the cases listed above, we will not disclose your personal data to third parties
                            for their independent use without your consent. In particular, we do not allow third parties
                            to access your personal content (images, videos, prompts) except as needed to operate the AI
                            generation features, and we do not allow third parties to use your data for advertising or
                            profiling except with your opt-in. If we ever consider additional sharing of personal data
                            (for example, new partnerships), we will update this Policy and notify you as required.

                            Data Storage and Retention</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Storage Location:</strong> We are a global service;
                            however, the primary data storage for our Service is currently on cloud servers located in
                            the United States and/or European Union (via Google Cloud), depending on where you are
                            located.
                            We strive to store data in the region closest to our users when feasible. Note that personal
                            data may be transferred to or accessible from our headquarters in Turkey for administrative
                            purposes, and our third-party processors (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.) may be located in the U.S.
                            or
                            other jurisdictions. Regardless of location, we apply the same security standards to your
                            data
                            (see Security below) and, where applicable, put legal safeguards in place for international
                            data transfers (see International Data Transfers below).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong> As mentioned, most
                            user-generated content (especially large media like photos and videos) is stored locally on
                            your device by design. Our mobile app keeps your projects, generated media, and edits on
                            your
                            phone/tablet unless you actively choose to back them up or share them. This means that, in
                            normal usage, we do not have a copy of your creative content on our servers. Temporary data
                            may pass through our servers during AI processing (for example, an image might be uploaded
                            temporarily to generate a result), but we do not retain that data longer than necessary to
                            complete the operation. We periodically clear cache and temporary storage on our servers to
                            ensure that user content isn't stored beyond its purpose. In short, we do not permanently
                            store your images, videos, or chat prompts on our servers – those remain under your control
                            on your device. (The only exceptions would be if you explicitly use a cloud backup/sync
                            feature that we offer, in which case we will inform you and get consent, or if a piece of
                            content triggers a moderation process due to violating policies, which might lead us to
                            retain it for investigation.)</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Retention Period:</strong> We retain personal data
                            only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, or as required by
                            law. The retention period can vary by data type and context:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Account Information:</strong> We keep your
                                account registration info (like name, email, and login credentials) for as long as your
                                account is active. If you decide to delete your account or you have not used the Service
                                for an extended period, we will initiate deletion of your account data from our live
                                systems. In general, once you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize personal
                                data within approximately 30 days, barring unforeseen technical delays. Some residual
                                data (e.g. in backups) may take slightly longer to purge, but we will not restore or
                                use it except for security, fraud prevention, or legal obligations.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>User Content and Generated Output:</strong> Any
                                user content that remains only on your device is under your control – you can delete it
                                at any time from the app or your device storage. For content that passed through our
                                servers for processing, we generally do not store it after the process completes. If any
                                such data is temporarily cached, it is typically deleted within hours. AI-generated
                                outputs
                                are not stored on our servers beyond delivering them to you, unless they are associated
                                with your account (e.g., a small metadata record that a generation occurred). We do not
                                build user-specific profiles of your content usage.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We retain payment
                                transaction records, subscription status, and purchase history as long as you use the
                                Service and for a reasonable period thereafter (to maintain financial records for
                                accounting/audit purposes). Even after account deletion, we may retain invoices or
                                minimal transaction logs as required by finance and tax regulations. However, as noted,
                                we never store raw payment card details ourselves.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Usage Logs and Analytics:</strong> Low-level
                                usage logs (like server request logs, IP addresses, device events) are typically kept
                                for a short period (a few weeks to a few months) for debugging and security monitoring,
                                then either deleted or aggregated. Aggregated analytics data (which no longer identifies
                                individuals) may be retained longer for historical analysis.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contacted
                                support or we corresponded via email, those communications may be retained for a period
                                to ensure we have context for any follow-up. Typically, support emails and chat logs are
                                kept for a few years at most, unless needed longer for legal reasons (e.g., evidence in

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong>Legal Requirements and Preventing Harm:</strong>
                                We may need to retain certain information if necessary to meet legal obligations or
                                resolve disputes. For example, if we deactivate an account due to abuse, we might retain
                                a record of that user's email or IP to block re-registration. Or if a law enforcement
                                request or preservation order is in effect, we will retain the relevant data as
                                required.
                                We will also retain data as necessary to comply with any record-keeping obligations
                                (such as financial records for X years under tax law).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            When we no longer have a legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will
                            securely delete it or anonymize it. If deletion is not immediately possible (for instance,
                            if the data is in backups), we will isolate it from further use until deletion is feasible.
                        </p>

                            International Data Transfers</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Parthenius AI Studio is available to users around the world. As a result, your personal data
                            may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than your own. In particular, if
                            you
                            are located in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland, your
                            personal data may be transferred to countries outside of those regions, including the United
                            States and Turkey. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from
                            (and
                            potentially less protective than) the laws of your jurisdiction.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            However, we take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your
                            personal data in line with this Policy wherever it is processed. Generative AI Teknoloji
                            A.Ş. primarily stores data on servers in the U.S. and EU, which means data may leave your
                            country. For transfers from the EEA/UK to non-EU countries, we rely on mechanisms such as
                            European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the UK International
                            Data Transfer Agreement, combined with additional security measures as needed. Our Data
                            Processing Agreements with third-party processors also incorporate similar standard clauses
                            or
                            other approved transfer safeguards when required. This means that our U.S.-based and other
                            non-EU service providers are contractually bound to protect EEA personal data to the high
                            standard required by EU law.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            In addition, some of our U.S. partners (like Google and Stripe) may be certified under
                            programs like the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (if available) or similar frameworks that
                            facilitate compliant data transfer. We also evaluate legal requirements in the destination
                            country and implement encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to data
                            across borders.

                            By using the Service or providing us your information, you consent to the transfer of your

                            Your Rights and Choices</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            You have certain rights regarding your personal data, which you can exercise under
                            applicable
                            data protection laws. We are committed to honoring your rights. These rights include, as
                            applicable:
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request confirmation
                            of whether we are processing your personal data, and if so, request a copy of the data we
                            hold about you. This allows you to know and verify the lawfulness of our processing.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If any of your
                            information is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or
                            update it. We encourage you to keep your profile information current, and you may do so
                            directly in the app settings (for basic account info) or by contacting support for
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You
                            may ask us to delete your personal data under certain circumstances. For example, if you no
                            longer want to use the Service, you can request account deletion, and we will remove
                            personal data that we are not required to keep. This right is not absolute – if we have a
                            legal obligation or compelling legitimate interest to retain certain data (for instance, to
                            comply with a regulatory requirement or if the data is relevant to an open legal claim), we
                            may decline the request for those specific pieces of data but will explain why.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right
                            to request a copy of the personal data you provided to us in a machine-readable format, and
                            you can ask that we transmit it to another service provider if technically feasible. For
                            example, you may request an export of your account information and any content you've
                            provided, so you can reuse it elsewhere.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request
                            that we temporarily limit our processing of your data in certain situations – for instance,
                            while you contest the accuracy of the data or object to our processing, or if we no longer
                            need the data but you want us to preserve it for legal reasons. When processing is
                            restricted, we will store your data securely and not use it (except as needed for legal
                            claims, with your consent, or to protect others) until the restriction is lifted.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object
                            to our processing of your personal data when that processing is based on legitimate
                            interests
                            or performed for direct marketing purposes. If you object, we will cease the processing
                            unless
                            we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, or if it's
                            needed for legal reasons. For direct marketing, if you object or opt-out, we will stop
                            sending you marketing communications.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on
                            your
                            consent to process personal data (for example, for sending promotional emails or using
                            non-essential cookies), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can do
                            so
                            by changing your settings in the app (if available), clicking "unsubscribe" in an email, or
                            contacting us. Note that withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of any
                            processing
                            done before your withdrawal. If you withdraw consent for a certain feature, that feature
                            might
                            not be available to you (for instance, if you disable location permission, location-based
                            features will be limited).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Additional Rights (California and Other
                                Jurisdictions):</strong> If you are a resident of certain states or countries, you may
                            have additional rights. For example, California residents have the right to request a notice
                            disclosing the categories of personal information and specific pieces of information we have
                            collected about you, as well as the categories of sources, purposes for collecting, and
                            third
                            parties with whom we share that information (essentially, the contents of this Privacy
                            Policy). You also have the right to request that we delete personal information (subject to
                            similar exceptions as above), and the right to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of
                            personal information if applicable. As stated, we do not sell personal data to third parties
                            for monetary consideration. We also do not share personal data for cross-context behavioral
                            advertising in a way that would be considered a "sale" or "share" under CCPA. If that ever
                            changes, we will provide a "Do Not Sell or Share" link.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            California law also provides that you have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment
                            for exercising your privacy rights. We honor that: if you exercise any of your rights, we
                            will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a lesser
                            quality
                            of service because of your choices.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Turkish residents:</strong> You have rights under KVKK
                            (Turkey's data protection law) including the right to learn if we hold your data, to request
                            correction or deletion of inaccurate or unlawfully processed data, and to object to certain
                            processing. You may contact us as described below to exercise these rights.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Other regions:</strong> If other privacy laws apply to
                            you
                            (such as Brazil's LGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, etc.), we will gladly facilitate your rights
                            requests in line with those laws as well.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Exercising Your Rights:</strong> You can submit requests
                            to access, correct, delete, or exercise any of your data rights by contacting us (see
                            Contact
                            Us section below). For certain rights (like data download or deletion), we may also provide
                            in-app options or self-service tools. For example, you may delete your account from within
                            the
                            app's account settings (if available), which triggers our deletion process. When you contact
                            us with a rights request, we will need to verify your identity to protect your privacy –
                            this
                            may involve confirming control of your email address or providing identifying information.
                            We
                            will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law (for instance, within 30
                            days for GDPR requests, which may be extended if necessary with notice to you). If we
                            decline
                            your request, we will explain the reason (e.g., if it's manifestly unfounded or excessive,
                            or
                            if a legal exception applies).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                            supervisory authority (for example, in the EU you can contact your country's data protection
                            authority; in the UK the ICO; in Turkey the KVKK board; in California the Attorney General
                            or
                            CPPA). We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns first, so we
                            encourage
                            you to contact us with any complaint and we will do our best to resolve it.

                            Security Measures</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            We take the security of your personal data very seriously and implement industry-standard
                            security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
                            destruction. Our security program includes both technical and organizational safeguards:
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Encryption:</strong> All network communication between
                            your app/browser and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS. This means that data in
                            transit is protected from eavesdropping. For sensitive data at rest (such as passwords,
                            which are stored as cryptographic hashes), we apply strong encryption or hashing.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Access Control:</strong> We limit access to personal
                            data strictly to those employees, contractors, and service providers who need it to operate
                            or
                            improve the Service. Access is controlled through role-based permissions, and our personnel
                            are required to adhere to confidentiality obligations. Administrative access to systems is
                            secured with multi-factor authentication and logging.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Secure Development Practices:</strong> Our engineering
                            team follows secure coding guidelines and we regularly update our software dependencies to
                            address security vulnerabilities. We also employ protections against common web attacks
                            (like
                            SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) in our platform.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Network and Infrastructure Security:</strong> Our
                            servers are protected by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and continuous monitoring.
                            We
                            deploy updates and patches promptly. We also isolate different systems to minimize the
                            impact
                            of any potential breach (segmentation).</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Testing and Auditing:</strong> We periodically test our
                            systems for security weaknesses, through practices like penetration testing and code
                            reviews.
                            We maintain logs of system activity and access to data, which helps in detecting and
                            investigating any irregular access. Additionally, when feasible, we enable security features
                            provided by our cloud platform (Google Cloud) such as threat detection.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> When we engage
                            third-party processors (Firebase, Stripe, etc.), we review their security standards to
                            ensure
                            they meet our requirements. We sign Data Processing Agreements that obligate them to protect
                            your data and notify us of any incidents. We also take steps such as enabling encryption and
                            configuring access keys carefully when using their services.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Organizational Policies:</strong> All our staff are
                            trained on data privacy and security. We have internal policies in place for how to handle
                            user data, and we limit personal device access to production data. Team members with access
                            to personal data undergo additional vetting and are required to use secure devices and
                            connections.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Despite our efforts, no system can be 100% secure. We therefore cannot guarantee absolute
                            security of your information. However, we will continue to update and improve our security
                            measures to combat new threats. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your
                            personal data, we will promptly notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law.
                            We
                            also have an incident response plan in place to handle such situations effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            You also play a role in keeping your data safe. Please use a strong, unique password for
                            your
                            account and do not share it. Notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to
                            your account. Be mindful of phishing attempts – we will never ask for your password via
                            email.
                            If you use our Service on a public or shared device, make sure to log out when you're done.

                            Parthenius AI Studio is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
                            collect personal information from anyone under 13 years old (and for EU residents, under 16
                            years old). If you are under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction), please
                            do not use our Service or provide any personal data to us.
                        </p>

                            If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child below the
                            minimum age, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible. If you are a
                            parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information
                            without your consent, please contact us immediately so that we can locate and delete the
                            data. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children's online activities and
                            educate them about safe internet use.

                            We may update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
                            practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make
                            material changes, we will provide notice to users in an appropriate manner – for example, by
                            posting the updated Policy with a new effective date on our website/app and updating the
                            "Last
                            Updated" date at the top, and in some cases we may notify you via email or in-app alert.
                            Please review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your
                            information. Your continued use of the Service after any changes to this Policy constitutes
                            your acceptance of the updated terms, to the extent permitted by law.

                            seek
                            your consent if required. For minor changes that do not materially affect your privacy
